Python for busy Neuroscientists. From "Hello World" to machine learning.

## Introduction
This is a Python crash course for complete beginners. In the first two weeks we will learn the fundamentals of Python using the freely available book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/)) (ATBS). The third and fourth week we will cover the basics of Python's data science ecosystem that you can use for analysis and visualization of data.

This is designed to be a "flipped" class rather than a traditional lecture. That is, each week you will spend time learning about, and practicing, Python outside of class. Then in class, you will spend time reinforcing key points, going over any remaining questions you have about the material, and reviewing code.

Here is how the class is structured by week:

## Outline
### Week 0: Setting up Jupyter and Python
This week you will set up your programming environment. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the *de facto* tool of choice for sharing code. For this week, just go to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) and follow the instructions there.

### Week 1: Python basics and flow control
Now that you can use Python and run Jupyter notebooks, you are ready to start doing Python. We will cover the basics of Python, and the important topic of flow control (for example, using `for` loops). This material corresponds to Chapters One and Two of Automate the Boring stuff and is covered in [week1.ipynb](week1.ipynb).

### Week 2: Functions and data structures
We will finish our overview of the fundamentals of Python by looking at functions and the main types of data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings). These topics correspond to Chapters 3-6 of Automate the Boring Stuff and can be found in the Jupyter notebook [week2.ipynb](week2.ipynb).

### Week 3: Intro to Python's data science ecosystem
Once you've learned the fundamentals of Python, you will be ready to start doing things with data. We'll learn about virtual environments, as well as Python's vaunted *data science ecosystem*. After reviewing the different tools in the ecosystem, we will dive in and start to learn about the most important tools. In Week 3 you will learn about `numpy` (a powerful numerical computing library) and `matplotlib` (Python's main plotting library). For this week, see  [week3.ipynb](week3.ipynb), which includes links to excellent introductions to these libraries, as well as a chance to use them within the notebook.  As always, practice is key!

### Week 4: From Pandas to machine learning
This final week, we will finish our tour of the most important components of the data science ecosystem in Python. First, an overview of `pandas` (a tool for analyzing tabular data sort of like you find in Excel).  Second, a taste of  `scikit-learn` (the powerful machine learning library). After this week, you will be comfortable not only with the Python standard library, but also importing and using the core tools in the data science ecosystem!

### To do
- for week1 class fix it to use two cameras: one for zoom, one to extract and do facial recog.
- Add open ended section at end of each class for students to write questions  (do for class 1 will serve as template students can email me those)
- Add "notes" section at end of each class for students to write notes for in-class section (do for class 1)
- getting_started needs quite a bit of work.
- Also need instructions on how to change default browswer in my windows fresh install it defaulted to bloody Edge :(
- do this readme pretty much last just make the classes.
