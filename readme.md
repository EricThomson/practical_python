Python for busy Neuroscientists. From "Hello World" to Deep Lab Cut.

## Introduction
This is a Python crash course for complete beginners. In the first two weeks we will learn the fundamentals of Python using the freely available book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/)) (ATBS). The third week we will cover the basics of the data science stack that you can use for analysis and visualization of data. The final week will be a deep dive into a practical project using Deep Lab Cut, a library for tracking animal behavior that uses deep learning and convolutional neural networks.

This is designed to be a "flipped" class: each week you will spend a lot of time learning and practicing coding outside of class. Then in class, we spend time reinforcing key points, going over questions you have about the material, and going over code with your instructor.

## Outline
### Week 0: Setting up Jupyter and Python
This week you will set up your programming environment. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the *de facto* tool of choice for sharing code. For this week, just go to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) and follow the instructions there.

### Week 1: Python basics and flow control
Now that you can use Python and run Jupyter notebooks, you are ready to start doing Python. We will cover the basics of Python, and the important topic of flow control (for example, using `for` loops). This material corresponds to Chapters One and Two of Automate the Boring stuff and is covered in [week1.ipynb](week1.ipynb).

### Week 2: Functions and data structures
We will finish out our overview of the fundamentals of Python by looking at functions in Python, and the main types of data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings). These topics correspond to Chapters 3-6 of Automate the Boring Stuff and can be found in the Jupyter notebook [week2.ipynb](week2.ipynb).

### Week 3: Files, virtual environments, and the data science stack
Now that you know the fundamentals of Python, you are ready to start doing things with data. We'll learn about virtual environments and Python's vaunted *data science stack*. Among other things, we will learn about the numerical computing library `numpy`, the plotting library `matplotlib`, and the analysis library `pandas`. For this week, see  [week3.ipynb](week3.ipynb), which includes links to excellent introductions to these libraries, as well as a chance to use them within the notebook.  As always, practice is key!

### Week 4: Deep lab cut
Using Python IRL. This week you will do a deep dive into a project that approaches the messiness of real life. It will be a lot of work, and your computer will work pretty hard too (many hours to train the model). You will see deep learning in action, and get hands-on skills with an extremely useful package.

### To do
- for week1 class fix it to use two cameras: one for zoom, one to extract and do facial recog.
- Add open ended section at end of each class for students to write questions  (do for class 1 will serve as template students can email me those)
- Add "notes" section at end of each class for students to write notes for in-class section (do for class 1)
- getting_started needs quite a bit of work.
- Also need instructions on how to change default browswer in my windows fresh install it defaulted to freaking MS Edge :(
- do this readme pretty much last just make the classes.
