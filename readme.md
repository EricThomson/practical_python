# Practical Python
A Python class where you can learn just enough of the basics to start looking at your data.

## Introduction
This is a Python class for complete beginners. Programming is largely muscle memory, so the best way to learn is through deliberate practice. While we will do four weeks of instruction, we will also try to focus on learning by *doing*.

This will be a flipped class, where you learn a lot before each class (using the excellent book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/)) (ATBS)) and then we meet in each class to discuss and work on practical problems. The goal is to do a crash course in the basics of Python the first two weeks, and then some basics of the data science stack the second two weeks. This will be fast-paced, and go over a small subset of the available material, but I hope a fun snapshot of an engaging language!

Each week you will spend a lot of time learning about Python, and practicing Python before each class. Then each class will be spent going over any questions you had about the material, reinforcing any key points, and doing code walkthroughs/pair programming exercise with your instructor.

[Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is a technique where two programmers get together and work on a problem together. I find it an extremely useful way to debug code. We will be doing something similar: a group code walkthrough to help bake in the ideas that you learned outside of class; something to provide the opportunity to ask questions about anything that might be unclear, and to tweak/fiddle with the code to explore what happens.

## Outline

### Week 0
This week you will set up programming environment, give it a test run, and set up the material for the class. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the tool of choice among scientists for expressing their ideas in Python.  For this material, just go to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) and follow the instructions there.

### Week 1
Now that you can use Python and run Jupyter notebooks, you are ready to start doing Python. For the first class, you should work through *Chapters 1: Python Basics* and *Chapter 2: Flow Control* from Automate the Boring Stuff. This corresponds to the Jupyter notebook [week1.ipynb](week1.ipynb).

### Week 2
Lists, Dictionaries, Strings, Functions.

### Week 3
Objects, Imports and virtual environments, and intro to the data science stack part 1.

### Week 4
Data science stack, part 2. Using Python IRL.

### To do
- Add open ended section at end of each class for them to write questions  (do for class 1 will serve as template students can email me those)
- Add "notes" section at end of each class for them to write notes for in-class section (do for class 1)
- when you finish class1, go in and add preview at end of class 0, or just have them read over class 1? Or make separate class 1 preview notebook?
- in general, getting_started needs quite a bit of work.
- Also need instructions on how to change default browswer in my windows fresh install it defaulted to freaking MS Edge :(
- do this readme pretty much last just make the classes.
