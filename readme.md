# Practical Python
A Python class where you can learn just enough of the basics to start examining data in Jupyter notebooks.

## Details
This is meant to be a semi-flipped class. In a fully flipped class, there would be no official teaching: you do reading and learning on your own, and come in and do practical work in class while the teacher basically acts as a facilitato. class and the teacher comes and basically comes to answer questions.

However, this is a class for people completely new to programming, I think such a trial by fire is probably not quite as helpful as having a more mixed approach with some conversation and instruction. However, each week I will be giving a Jupyter notebook to practice with to learn things before coming to class. I liken this to parking your car facing downhill so you can just release the breaks and start going fast.

### Week 0
Please do this before our first meeting: install things and make sure it works so we don't spend the first week in "My Python is broken wasteland"

### Week 1

### Week 2

### Week 3

### Week 4

### To do
- Remove discussion of flipped just talk about parking downhill.
- Add borders to figures.
- save first notebook as notebook0 instead of whatever it is.
- start making class1.
