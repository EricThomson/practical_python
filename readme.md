# Practical Python
A Python class where you can learn just enough of the basics to start looking at your data.

## Details
This is a Python class for complete beginners. Programming is largely muscle memory, so the best way to learn is through deliberate practice. While we will do a lot of instruction, we will also try to focus on learning by *doing*.

This will be a flipped class, where you learn a lot before each class (using the excellent book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/)) (ATBSWP)) and then we meet in each class to discuss and work on practical problems. The goal is to do a crash course in the basics of Python the first two weeks, and then some basics of the data science stack the second two weeks. This will be fast-paced, and very selective, but I hope fun!

### Week 0
This week you will set up programming environment, give it a test run, and set up the material for the class. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the tool of choice among scientists for expressing their ideas in Python.  For this material, just go to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) and follow the instructions there.

### Week 1
You will go through *Chapters 1: Python Basics* and *Chapter 2: Flow Control* from Automate the Boring Stuff in the Jupyter notebook [week1.ipynb](week1.ipynb).

### Week 2
Lists, Dictionaries, Strings, Functions.

### Week 3
Objects, Imports and virtual environments, and intro to the data science stack part 1.

### Week 4
Data science stack, part 2. Using Python IRL.

### To do
- when you finish class1, go in and add preview at end of class 0, or just have them read over class 1? Or make separate class 1 preview notebook?
- in general, getting_started needs a bit of work. Also, instructions on how to change default browswer in my windows fresh install it defaulted to freaking MS Edge :( 
- do this readme pretty much last just make the classes.
