# Practical Python
A Python class where you can learn just enough of the basics to start examining data in Jupyter notebooks. [Under construction!]

## Details
This is a Python class for beginners. Programming is largely muscle memory, so a good way to learn is through practice (e.g., like getting better at free throws in basketball). While we will do a lot of instruction, we will also try to focus on learning by *doing*.  

### Week 0
This week you will set up programming environment, give it a test run, and set up the material for the class. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the tool of choice among scientists for expressing their ideas in Python.  For this material, just go to [getting_started.md](getting_started.md) and follow the instructions there.

### Week 1

### Week 2

### Week 3

### Week 4

### To do
- Step 3 of getting_started.md needs to be written up nicely.
- when you finish class1, go in and add preview at end of class 0, or just have them read over class 1? Or make separate class 1 preview notebook?
- Add borders to figures.
- start making class1.
