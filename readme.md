# Practical Python
A Python class where you can learn just enough of the basics to start examining data in Jupyter notebooks.

## Details
This is a class for complete beginners. It is a *semi-flipped* class in that we will do a lot of practical engagement with coding both inside and outside the (online) classroom, but with a significant preparation and preview before each class to maximize the impact. Rather than a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), where students do all the instructional material at home and all the practical material in class where the teacher can help, I liken this to "parking downhill". You will get a bit of practical preview and instruction before each class so that we can release the breaks and learn at an accelerated rate, with a mixture of practical examples and instruction each week.

You should expect quite a bit of *repetitiove practical engagement*. Programming is 80% muscle memory, so the way you learn to do it isn't to read and memorize things (e.g., Kreb's Cycle), but the way you learn to ride a bike or flip a pancake: by practicing a lot (i.e., 25 minutes every day of the week is better than 3 hours once a week)

We will be learning Python through the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), which have become the tool of choice among scientists for expressing their ideas in Python. You will start to see why in the Week 0 lesson.

### Week 0
In ways, this is going to be the hardest class, because it will be what you do *before* we ever meet. Here you will be installing your Python programming environment, giving it a test run, cloning the Jupyter notebooks from github and making sure everything is running. If you can do this stuff, you will absolutely be able to do everything else in the class.

I would give yourself a solid 6 hours spread out over a few days to work through the material here so you are sure to be ready for our first in-person class. The material is in:

- [getting_started.md](getting_started.md)
This explains how to install Python and Jupyter, how to test run Python and run your first Jupyter notebook. Going through the initial setup in this step will probably take a couple of hours.
- [week0.ipynb](week0.ipynb)
Your first Jupyter notebook, which you will be downloading from github and running locally once you have set up your local programming environment as laid out in `getting_started.md`. Going through these bits will probalby take a couple of hours.

### Week 1

### Week 2

### Week 3

### Week 4

### To do
- Remove discussion of flipped just talk about parking downhill.
- Add borders to figures.
- save first notebook as notebook0 instead of whatever it is.
- start making class1.
