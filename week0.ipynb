They also include *debuggers* to help you identify and remove errrors, and they often include connections to code repositories to make it easier to  publish your code to places like Github.

    "While an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is meant for writing code with blazing efficiency, Jupyter notebooks are more conducive for learning to code, and communicating scientific ideas.

One nice thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can use them to program in many different languages. \n",

    "In my experience, when teaching Python, I once used an IDE, but recently all my students always gravitated toward Jupyter notebooks for their ease of use and nice formatting.

A second, *markdown* mode lets you enter formatted text like you are reading now. (There are other modes, but we will ignore them).\n",
