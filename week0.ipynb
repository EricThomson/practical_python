IDEs include *debuggers* to help you identify and remove errrors; they often include connections to code repositories to make it easier to  publish your code to places like Github for other people to download and use your code.

    "This move toward Jupyter has not been just for the neophyte: Jupyter has become the common language for communication among Python programmers. New books and software packages now demo their work using Jupyter notebooks, because it is just assumed that everyone reading will be comfortable learning using these tools. Also, all three of the cloud computing services (Amazon Web Services, Google Colabs, and Microsoft Azure) use some version of Jupyter notebooks for cloud-based computing. So if you can read and use Jupyter notebooks, then you understand the most cutting edge tool being used for generating large-scale analysis infrastructure in the cloud.\n",

The button that says *Run* will run the code in a cell (or format and display the markdown). If you hover your mouse cursor over an icon for a bit, a little text description of what will happen if you click will appear.\n",
