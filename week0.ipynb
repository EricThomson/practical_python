    "What are we doing here? The way this class will work, as mentioned in [readme.md](readme.md) this is going to be a kind of semi-flipped class, where instead of traditional instruction in class followed by practical work outside of class, we will be doing learning a mixture of insructuion and practice before each class. You have already done quite a bit of practice by setting up your programming environment. \n",

    "2. How do you write text and code into the notebooks?\n",
    "3. A very brief preview of Python.\n",

One nice thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can use them to program in many different languages."

It is a glorified calculator that can scale up to handle some of the most complicated tasks you can throw at it. HOw do they work, though? All Python programs work pretty much the same way: you have some code, such as the expression `1+1`, and you send it off to the *Python interpreter* which then reads this code and produces the appropriate output (`2`). \n",

    "\n",
    "At the simplest, you could use a text editor like Wordpad or Google Docs to write your code, and then send it off to the Python interpreter. At the other extreme, there are things known as *IDEs* (Integrated Development Environments). IDEs are fancy software platforms that let you do much more than write code. They also include *debuggers* to help you remove errrors; some will even communicate with the internet so you can easily publish your code to public *repositories* like Github. If you are curious about Python IDEs, you can Google them: some of the more popular ones include *Spyder*, *Eric*, *IDLE*, *PyCharm*, and *Visual Studio Code*. [more here]\n",

    "While an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is meant for writing code efficiently, Jupyter notebooks are more conducive to learning and communicating programming ideas. A Jupyter notebook combines the ability to run Python code with the ability to display text that is formatted in a pleasing way, so people can more readily understand what you are trying to say. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done with the ingenious, and sometimes confusing, use of *two modes of entering information*. One, the *code* mode, lets you enter Python code. Second, *markdown* mode lets you enter nicely entering formatted text like you are reading now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may all sound tricky or confusing, but I guarantee you will get the hang of it. Jupyter provides two great services. On one hand, a convenient interface with your Python interpreter for writing code. On the other hand, a relatively mechanism for displaying formatted text in a way that future you, and other people, will be able to follow. And as you've probably noticed by now, you can even integrate pictures into your markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, when teaching students how to code, they tend to gravitate toward Jupyter notebooks over other options. They are relatively easy to use, and fun to read. This ease of use, and the resulting nicely formatted documents, is what made me decide to write these lessons as Jupyter notebooks. \n",
