    "We learned in the previous lesson that Python is a really good programming language for beginners. It is a glorified calculator that can scale up to handle some of the most complicated tasks you can throw at it. How do Python programs work, though? All Python programs work pretty much the same way: you have some code, such as the expression `1+1`, and you send it off to the *Python interpreter* which then reads this code and produces the appropriate output (`2`). \n",

At the other extreme, there are things known as *IDEs* (Integrated Development Environments). IDEs are fancy software platforms that let you do much more than write code. They also include *debuggers* to help you remove errrors; some will even communicate with the internet so you can easily publish your code to public *repositories* like Github. If you are curious about Python IDEs, you can Google them: some of the more popular ones include *Spyder*, *Eric*, *IDLE*, *PyCharm*, *Visual Studio Code*, and even more."

One nice thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can use them to program in many different languages. I actually learned to write Javascript (poorly) using Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, when teaching students how to code, I once taught them using an IDE, but they always tended to gravitate toward Jupyter notebooks over other options, so now I have decided to just stop fighting it. They are relatively easy to use, and fun to read. This ease of use, and the resulting nicely formatted documents, is what made me decide to write these lessons as Jupyter notebooks. \n",

    "Jupyter notebooks trade on an ingenious, and sometimes confusing, use of *two modes of entering information*. One, the *code* mode, lets you enter Python code. A second, *markdown* mode lets you enter nicely entering formatted text like you are reading now. (There are actually other modes, but let's ignore them for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "This may all sound tricky or confusing, but I guarantee you will get the hang of it. Basically, Jupyter provides two great services in one: on one hand, a convenient interface with your Python interpreter for writing code. On the other hand, a simple mechanism for displaying formatted text in a way that future you, and other people, will be able to follow. And as you've probably noticed by now, you can even integrate pictures into your markdown. \n",
