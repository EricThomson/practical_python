    "# Week 1: Python Basics and Program Control\n",
    "Now that the hard part (setting up your envirnoment) is done, the fun part can begin -- actually coding. Since we are doing a flipped course, this is where the learning will really happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main course content is from the excellent online book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/) by Al Sweigart. This week you will be going over Chapter 1 and 2 of the book. These notebooks will basically be a guide with links to the course content, notes on translating some of his exercises to a Jupyter notebook context, videos from Al Sweigart, and providing a space to actually *practice coding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translating from IDE-speak to Jupyter\n",
    "There is one wrinkle when typing the code yourself: Sweigart's book was written for people using an IDE, not Jupyter. Hence, there are a couple of changes you should make when following along the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the book says to test out some code in your interactive Python shell, you should just type that code in a Jupyter cell (in code mode) and run it using `shift-enter` as discussed in the notebook for [Week 0](week0.ipynb). \n",
    "- When the book has you save code as a separate python file in the file editor (to be saved as something like `xyz.py`), do the same thing -- write it all into a cell in Jupyter, and run it using `shift-enter`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will eventually talk about how to store code in separate files and import it, but for now let's keep it simple and just keep all our code in our Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Videos\n",
    "Sweigart also has [a video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW ) for his book, and the first 15 are available free at YouTube. These videos can be a helpful supplement to the written word, so I will embed the videos below as an optional potentially helpful supplement."

For this first week to make it easier I'm putting different section headings in markdown with code cells below them for you to practice code in, just to give a sense for how I would go about structuring my work. In the future I'll leave it up to you how to structure your work."
