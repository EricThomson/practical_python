    "This is our second and last weeek with ATBS!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed at the end of Week 1 in class, this week we are going to be covering the final bits of Python basics: functions and the main types of data structures. We will be covering more chapters than last week, but it will be less work because other than learning about functions (admittedly a substantive topic), most of this week will involve learning about different data structures, which is fairly straightforward stuff. \n",

    "- [Chapter 3: Functions](#chapter3)\n",
    "- [Chapter 4: Lists and Tuples](#chapter4)\n",
    "- [Chapter 5: Dictionaries](#chapter5)\n",
    "- [Chapter 6: Strings](#chapter6)\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation for picking up the material is the same as last week: make lots of cells and mess around with code: tweak and twiddle with the examples to see what happens. Coding is largely muscle memory, so it is really important to literally *type code*, especially when learning the basics. If you run into error messages, first make sure there isn't an obvious mistake in the code (an unclosed paren or quotation mark). Second, read the error message that pops up: they are often helpful. Barring that, Google the error message there are great resources online. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this week we will be skipping quite a bit\n",
    "There are going to be quite a few sections I recommend skipping in ATBS. You obviously don't *have* to skip them, but I'm asking you to cover a lot of material this week, so think it is important to stick to the essentials of the language and not focus on every single detail. Those of you who really want to burrow into the details, obviously feel free!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Sweigart will start to introduce some more time-consuming programming projects in these chapters. I'm a huge advocate of learning via practical projects, but you'll notice I'm suggesting you skip them. This is a practical decision: covering four chapters in one week is already a lot of work, so I think it is enough to just spend your time tweaking and fiddling with the coding examples in the main body of the chapters. That *is* your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, our goal is to get into more data-analysis relevant material, and we will have more project-type stuff in future weeks. However, if you have time left over and *want* to work on those projects, by all means please do! If you want to check your work (or just look at some examples) there are people that have done them and posted their work online ([this repo seems good](https://github.com/kudeh/automate-the-boring-stuff-projects))."

If you find yourself repeating it across multiple files, you almost certainly should put it into a function and then import it. As Sweigart says, this is just a much more efficient way to program: if you improve the code, you will onlly have to do it once instead of everyplace you have it duplicated."

However, you should know that everything in Python is technically an *object*. All the numerical types, lists, strings, are all objects. Don't worry about what that means, you can just take it as an undefined primitive term. As we've discussed previously, to find out what *type* of object you are dealing with, you can use the `type(thing)` function. \n",

    "\n",
    "This week, we will learn a few methods that apply to lists. More generally, we will learn some methods to apply to all the data structures in this class. Methods are basically really useful tools for doing things with/to objects. You could easily do them using traditional functions, so you can think of methods as a specialized route to a similar outcome: when you use a method it is saying \"This is meant to apply to this type of object. Someome took the time to write a function specifically for this type of object, just to make things more convenient.\"\n",

If you want to learn about objects/classes there is a nice self-contained tutorial [here](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) that I almost included in the class. If you want to learn about objects and object-oriented programming, then I would read that, and work on the examples there. It is not very complicated, it is very cool, and definitely worth learning."
