Since we are done with ATBS, it is time to delegate our flipped teaching responsibilities to multiple sources. I basically scoured the internet for readable, beginner-friendly, but practical introductions to the topics we are covering.

There is really no major break in method when learning to use the in the standard library and tools in third-party libraries:  make lots of cells and mess around with code. Tweak and twiddle with the examples in the videos and web pages to see what happens. Coding is largely muscle memory, so it is really important to literally *type code* rather than just read and understand the tutorials. If you run into error messages, first just inspect your code to make sure there isn't an obvious mistake (an unclosed paren or quotation mark). Second, read the error message: they are sometimes helpful. Barring that, Google the error message there are great resources online. "

    "You will often hear about Python *data science stack*, which is the main set of Python libraries that people use to analyze and visualize their data. It includes libraries for numerical computing, plotting, statistical tests, and much more. If you want to analyze data, there is a core set of libraries to be familiar with. This does not mean you need to be an expert: it is more about being comfortable enough to install and use the library's basic functionality (one secret with these libraries is just a handful of commands is enough). \n",

While I will write/talk about the data science stack, this metaphor implies some foundation where one piece builds on another. The data analysis tools form more of an **ecosystem**, an interconnected web of software packages all geared toward helping you analyze your data. Here is a cross-section through some of the resources available in Python:\n",

Then there are more peripheral packages located more at the edges of the web. These are the ones that you will pick up when you have a particular need (e.g., you don't need to learn Tensorflow unless you are doing a particular type of machine learning project). The more peripheral packages aren't lower quality, they are just *specialized* for particular tasks that many people will never need. All the packages are typically very high quality, that's how they make it into the ecosystem.\n",

    "I can't stress enough: you **do not need** to learn all these packages. That would be a waste of time, especially when starting out.

    "\n",
    "- **numpy**: NumPy is a numerical computing library that supports extremely efficient array computations (as we will see, arrays are basically containers for numbers and are extremely useful for representing data). It also has basic mathematical operations and statistical calculations on those numerical arrays. NumPy forms the basis for almost all packages that perform operations on numbers.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Matlplotlib is the core plotting library for Python. \n",
    "- **scipy**: Scipy is a scientific computing package that is basically one abstraction level up from NumPy. It includes basic statistics, optimization, numerical integration,  and other scientific computing tools. It is a sort of grab-bag for useful computations that you will use across multiple projects. \n",

    "- **Pandas**: an extremely user-friendly package for handling tabular data (basically, data arranged in something like an Excel spreadsheet). Pandas includes tools for analysis as well as plotting such data. It builds extensively on numpy and Matplotlib. Below, we will learn the basics of Pandas, partly because it is used extensively in Neuroscience, and because a lot of data in neuroscience is stored in the `csv` format.\n",
    "- **Pillow**: A simple image processing library (initially, there was PIL (Python Image Library) and Pillow is based on it). Allows for reading/writing images, converting between image types, and applying simple filters (e.g., contrast/smoothing) to images. \n",
    "- **OpenCv**: An extremely powerful computer vision library. Written in C++, a Python wrapper lets you use it using pure Python. It allows you to capture video from your web camera, read and write movies, and has tools for extensive processing and filtering of your images and movies, including machine vision in real time (e.g., facial recognition). \n",
    "- **scikit-learn**: The main machine learning library when you want to do traditional (not-neural network based) machine learning. It has tools for classification, clustering, and regression. It has a consistent interface for these problems, and is fairly intuitive to use.\n",
    "- **tensorflow/pytorch**: These are the two main *deep learning* packages that use artificial neural networks to let you tap into the power of cutting edge machine learning algorithms. Tensorflow was developed by Google and has been around longer, while Pytorch was developed by Facebook and is a bit easier to use and learn. Such approaches tend to work great for complex machine vision problems, but are often not necessary (i.e., scikit-learn is often more than enough). \n",
    "- **Plotly / Bokeh / Seaborn (etc)**: while Matplotlib is a great plotting library, there are some limitations. Because of this, there has been [a proliferation of plotting libraries in Python](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lessons/L7/python-plotting.html). I've just listed some of the more popular ones here. *Seaborn* is built on Matplotlib and provides an intuitive interface to generate beautiful plots even with complex data, plots that would take many many lines of code using Matplotlib.  *Plotly* and *Bokeh* allow you to embed beautiful interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks: they are basically Python interfaces with a Javascript (web-page friendly) back end. Plotly and Bokeh can also be integrated into dashboards that you can share online, or even in the cloud. \n",
    "- **sympy**: the symbolic mathematics library for Python. This is not used that much by people tussling with real messy data. However, if you need an *exact* solution to an equation, then you can use `sympy`. \n",
    "- **statsmodels**: for specialized or advanced statistical analysis: if SciPy doesn't have what you need, check statsmodels. This used to be part of SciPy, but branched off into its own specialized package.\n",
    "- **PyMC3**: A tool specialized for Bayesian modeling and inference. "

    "Similarly, as discussed in `week0.ipynb`,  *integrated development environments* (IDEs) are extremely important components of any programmer's workflow: Jupyter notebooks simply cannot compare in terms of power/speed/efficiency for writing and refactoring code. Jupyter notebooks have been a boon for *communicating* code. Our purpose here is more didactic, and Jupyter notebooks are often sufficient for most analysis purposes: if you ever feel the need to go beyond the notebook, to something more powerful, then there are plenty available (see Section 2 of `week0.ipynb` where we went over some options)."
